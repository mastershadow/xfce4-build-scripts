# xfce4-build-scripts

**xfce4-dev-updater.sh** updates the git sources

**xfce4-dev-build.sh** builds everything

**xfce4-dev-install.sh** installs everything

These scripts have to be considered as alpha version.

I wrote them to make my life a lot easier :)



Take a look to http://docs.xfce.org/xfce/building before doing anything.

Ciao,
