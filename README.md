# xfce4-build-scripts

**xfce4-dev-updater.sh** updates the git sources

**xfce4-dev-build.sh** builds and installs everything (taking care of dependencies)

**xfce4-dev-settings.sh** contains some settings you may want to customize

These scripts have to be considered as alpha version.

I wrote them to make my life a lot easier :)
Feel free to improve them and propose a patch ^_^



Take a look to http://docs.xfce.org/xfce/building before doing anything.

Ciao,
Eduard
